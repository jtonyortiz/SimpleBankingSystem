Simple Banking System Project in Java

## Stage 2 - Implement Luhn Algorithm (Completed)
In this stage, we will find out what the purpose of the checksum is and what the Luhn algorithm is used for.

### Description
The main purpose of the check digit is to verify that the card number is valid. Say you're buying something online, and you type in your credit card number incorrectly by accidentally swapping two digits, which is one of the most common errors. When the website looks at the number you've entered and applies the Luhn algorithm to the first 15 digits, the result won't match the 16th digit on the number you entered. The computer knows the number is invalid, and it knows the number will be rejected if it tries to submit the purchase for approval, so you're asked to re-enter the number. Another purpose of the check digit is to catch clumsy attempts to create fake credit card numbers. Those who are familiar with the Luhn algorithm, however, could get past this particular security measure.

### Objective 
You should allow customers to create a new account in our banking system.

Once the program starts you should print the menu:

1. Create an account
2. Log into the account
0. Exit

If the customer chooses ‘Create an account’, you should generate a new card number that satisfies all the conditions described above. Then you should generate a PIN code that belongs to the generated card number. A PIN is a sequence of 4 digits; it should be generated in the range from 0000 to 9999.

If the customer chooses ‘Log into account’, you should ask to enter card information.

After the information has been entered correctly, you should allow the user to check the account balance; after creating the account, the balance should be 0. It should also be possible to log out of the account and exit the program.
